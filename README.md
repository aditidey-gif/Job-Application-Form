This form includes essential fields such as:
âœ¦ First Name 
âœ¦ Middle Name (Optional)
âœ¦ Last Name
âœ¦ Email
âœ¦ Contact
âœ¦ Job Role 
âœ¦ Qualification
âœ¦ Address
âœ¦ City
âœ¦ State
âœ¦ Country
âœ¦ Pincode
âœ¦ Date of birth
âœ¦ CV upload

Some of the key features that make this form stand out include:

âœ¦ **Input validation:** Phone number and pincode fields only accept numbers, ensuring accurate data collection.

âœ¦ **Label-associated inputs:** Clicking on the label automatically focuses on the corresponding input field, enhancing user experience.

âœ¦ **Hover effects:** Input fields change border color on hover, providing visual feedback and guiding users through the form.

âœ¦ **Flexible file upload:** Candidates can upload their CVs in various formats, including PDF, JPG, and more.

âœ¦ **Interactive submit button**: A color change effect on click indicates successful submission, and users are redirected to a response page.

âœ¦ **Seamless navigation:** A "Submit another application" link allows users to easily return to the form page and apply for another opportunity.

And to top it off, I've made this webpage dynamic using @media queries, ensuring a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. Whether you're viewing it on a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone, the layout and user experience remain seamless and intuitive. ðŸ“±ðŸ’»
